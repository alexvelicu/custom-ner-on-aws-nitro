# Sample SSH config file to help connect to the Nitro instance
# via the bastion instance
#
# Usage:
#    Replace parameters with correct ones. Then you can use
#    the following commands:
#    If a bastion is used:
#        > ssh bastion-instance
#        > ssh nitro-instance-bastion
#    or, if no bastion is used:
#        > ssh nitro-instance
